  <h2><strong>The Long Winding Road</strong></h2>
    <p>When starting out in the Epicodus program I didnt expect to be aquiring so much information at such a rapid pace. In the short amount of time given in the first couple of weeks i was able to piece together a few webpages using nothing but coding languages. This process of interacting with the fundamentals of programming filled me with excitement and anxiety. Through many trials and tribulations I was able to complete something to add in a list of accomplishment. It is here that i would like to list a few of those.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The first attempt I made at successful code was
      <a <span class="red" href="https://github.com/SeanJulius/my-first-website.git"><strong><em>My-First-Website</em></strong>
      </span></a>, which included HTML and CSS.
    </li>
    <li>The next attempt at a webpage was a little more bland but worked with the use of HTML and CSS resulting in, 
      <a <span class="red" href="https://github.com/SeanJulius/blog.git"><strong><em>Blog</em></strong>
      </span></a>.
    </li>
    <li>The webpage I ended up being most proud of early on in my coding, using HTML and CSS, was 
      <a <span class="red" href="https://github.com/SeanJulius/Animal-Shelter.git"><strong><em>Animal-Shelter</em></strong>
      </span></a>. This success was in part from the help of two brilliant fellow students.
